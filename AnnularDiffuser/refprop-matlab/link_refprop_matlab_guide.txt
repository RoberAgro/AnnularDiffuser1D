1) Install REFPROP in the (default) path:

	C:\Program Files (x86)\REFPROP\


2) Copy the .dll file:

	REFPRP64_thunk_pcwin64

into the REFPROP folder


3) Always include the MATLAB functions

	refpropm.m
	rp_proto64.m

in the same folder as your MATLAB script (MATLAB needs these two functions to call REFPROP)


4) Run the MATLAB script refprop_test.m to check that the installation was successful



Additional info:

	The function refpropm.m has all the information needed to learn how to use REFPROP (syntax and variable names).
	The function refpropm.m also has some examples about how to do computations with REFPROP-MATLAB
	All the files that you need are included in the link_refprop_matlab folder.
